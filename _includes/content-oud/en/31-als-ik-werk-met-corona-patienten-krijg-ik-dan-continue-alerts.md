CoronaMelder only sends a notification after someone has tested positive. The app will not save this notification, nor will it send repeated notifications after that.

If you are working with coronavirus patients, it is possible to pause the CoronaMelder app to prevent false notifications being sent, as long as you are using PPE. 

<a href="/en/faq/24-kan-ik-de-app-pauzeren/">See “Can I pause the app while I am at school, at work or exercising?” for instructions.</a>

If you are not using PPE, it is still recommended to use CoronaMelder and to leave the app running.

You could receive the following notification: ‘In the past 24 hours, CoronaMelder has been unable to check whether you have been near to people who have tested positive for coronavirus. Check that your Wi-Fi or mobile data is switched on and try again.’ You will get this notification if your phone has had no internet connection for 24 hours or your battery optimisation settings are preventing the app from functioning properly.

To ensure that CoronaMelder continues working properly, you can open the app once a day or adjust the settings of your phone.

1. Go to the ‘Battery’ settings menu in your phone.
2. Turn this off for CoronaMelder. The exact method for doing this will vary depending on which phone you have. Once you have changed the battery settings, you will no longer receive this notification. Battery optimisation will continue to work in the same way for all the other apps on your phone.

This notification is mainly sent on phones with Android 9 and 10, and on devices made by Huawei, Xiaomi and OnePlus.

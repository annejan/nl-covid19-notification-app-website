No, there is another app for that: <a href="https://coronacheck.nl/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoronaCheck</a>. You need a COVID certificate to access certain locations or activities. Use the CoronaCheck app or go to <a href="https://coronacheck.nl/en/print" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.coronacheck.nl/en/print</a> to prove that you:

- are fully vaccinated;
- have recovered from infection with the coronavirus in the last six months;
- have tested negative for the coronavirus.

You can also use the CoronaCheck app to generate an international QR code, which you can use to travel within Europe.

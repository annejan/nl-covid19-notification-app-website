From version 2.0 of CoronaMelder, made available on May 17, 2021, the app uses new software from Google and Apple to measure Bluetooth signals.

Before the transition to this new software, it was first extensively tested. This shows that the reliability of reports is approximately 5-10% higher than before:

- In 84% of the cases that someone has to be notified, this also happens (this was 73%).
- In 74% of the cases that someone should not be notified, this does not happen (this was 73%). In fact, if the other phone is on the other side of a wall or floor, it is 87% of the time.

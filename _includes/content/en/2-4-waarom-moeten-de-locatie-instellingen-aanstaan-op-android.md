If you use an Android phone, you may need to turn on location data in order to use the CoronaMelder app. This will only be the case if you are using a version of Android lower than 11. With Android version 11 or higher, location settings do not have to be turned on in order to use the CoronaMelder app.

The CoronaMelder app can never access your location. The app uses Bluetooth, but only to find out if you are close to another person who is using the app. The app uses Bluetooth Low Energy to do this.

Android phones up to version 10 can only use Bluetooth Low Energy if the location settings are turned on. This is why your phone will ask you to turn on your location settings when you activate the CoronaMelder app.

You can check for yourself that your location is not being logged by looking under the location settings on your phone. The method for doing this will depend on which model you have.

The above only applies to Android devices, not to iPhones. You can keep your location settings turned off at all times on all iPhone models.

If you receive a notification, it means you have been near someone who has later tested positive for coronavirus. Don’t panic: this doesn’t mean for sure that you have coronavirus too. It means you have been in a high-risk situation: you could have been infected with coronavirus.

If you have caught the virus, you could pass it on to other people. Even if you've been vaccinated. In the notification you will get in the CoronaMelder app, you will find more information on what to do next.

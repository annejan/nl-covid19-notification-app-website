The CoronaMelder app checks several times a day whether the GGD has confirmed new infections. Every time new codes for new infections are downloaded on your phone, a line of numbers appears in the exposure log. These numbers are the times at which the CoronaMelder app downloaded new infection codes from the server.

If you can see all numbers in the log, the app is working correctly.

CoronaMelder uses software from Google and Apple to measure Bluetooth signals. Google and Apple have now released a new version of this software. To ensure that CoronaMelder remains safe and accurate, the app now uses that new software.

The new software also has a number of important advantages:

1. The measurements from CoronaMelder are more reliable
The reliability of the notification is approximately 5 to 10% higher than in the previous versions of CoronaMelder. For example, the app measures better whether another phone is on the other side of a wall or floor.

2. The measurements from CoronaMelder add up
If you are several times on the same day in the vicinity of someone who later turns out to be infected, and you were close to each other for a total of 15 minutes, you will receive a notification in the new version of CoronaMelder. In the previous versions of CoronaMelder, you would only get a notification if you were in the vicinity of someone who later turned out to be infected for 15 minutes in a row.

3. The reports in CoronaMelder are more accurate
The notification that you have been in the vicinity of someone who later turned out to be infected will now indicate the day with the most recent risky contact (a total of 15 minutes or more close to someone who later turned out to be infected). The previous versions stated the day on which you last had contact with that person in question, even if that contact was short and not risky. This could lead to confusion.

For example:
- On Monday you are close to a person who also uses CoronaMelder for a total of 15 minutes.
- On Tuesday you are close to the same person for 1 minute.
- On Wednesday, this person reports to be infected via CoronaMelder.

Based on this situation, the notification in previous versions of CoronaMelder stated that you had been in the vicinity of someone who turned out to be infected on Tuesday, because that was the **last** contact. Because that contact was not risky, the report could lead to confusion.

As of version 2.0 of CoronaMelder, the notification indicates that you were in the vicinity of someone who turned out to be infected on Monday, because that was the last **risky** contact.

You can pass coronavirus on to other people even if you do not have symptoms. The earlier you find out that you have (or could have) coronavirus, the easier it is to make sure you do not pass it on to other people. The CoronaMelder app helps you do this.

If you receive a notification from the app, you should stay at home for 10 days after the date of contact with an infected person. This way, you can avoid infecting your parents or grandparents, for example. And you can avoid spreading the virus in busy places, such as a market or sports event.

If you develop symptoms within those 10 days or afterwards, you can call <a href="tel:0800-1202">0800-1202</a> or go to <a href="https://www.coronatest.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coronatest.nl</a> to arrange a coronavirus test, free of charge.
